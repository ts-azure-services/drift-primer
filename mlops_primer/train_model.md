# Model Training
- Should be the shortest section.
- Leverage AutoML, and showcase Azure ML capabilities this way.
	- Highlight top features that are presented (showcase capabilities of the platform)
	- Showcase the metrics and what comes back as key views
- Insist on using a pipeline that can be re-used later for training.
	- Highlight the difference between the initial script to create the pipeline.
	- And the script to run an existing pipeline.
- Specifically highlight versioning, data registration capabilities to show lineage.

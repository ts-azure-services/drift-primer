# Model Deployment
- Deploy using managed online endpoint or an AKS cluster?
- If you need the blue/green deployment later, might need AKS.
- If you want to promote the managed online endpoint better, use that (given v2 focus)
- Briefly evaluate if you need to deploy through the inferencing in AML, and what other options exist
  (packaging as a Docker container, Flask app etc.)

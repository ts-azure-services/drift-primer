# Model Costs
It's been stressed before that prioritizing machine learning projects is a function of impact and cost.
Considering the 'cost' of running the above scenarios, we can see the full bill broken out as follows:
	- Initial training $xxx
	- Ongoing model maintenance (estimated) $xxx
	- Repeat training, and model deployment $xxx
- The model was primarily run on < type of machine >
- The experiments took on average < x time >
- This needs to be judged against the impact of the efforts to identify customers and then work with them to
  ensure better retention. If the cost of acquiring a net new customer is $x, and this improves the process of
  retention, this well have paid have resulted in an ROI of 10x.

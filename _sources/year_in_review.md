# A Year in Review
It's been nearly a year since the team first embarked upon creating an ML model for predicting churn. Along
the way, many changes have happened. The MLOps team has had to update for changes for new data, and respond to
changes in the distribution and relationships of the underlying data. None of this has been done in siloes,
but in active participation with the marketing organization. The team has also grown familiar with the 
operations of Azure Machine Learning, and learned how to leverage the system to hit a range of goals around
performance, data lineage, governance and with AutoML, taken advantage of the best algorithms out there. While
this was a simple example, the team is now geared up to further expand the range of possible ML solutions to
target even more use cases around customer experience.

We hope you've enjoyed this primer!

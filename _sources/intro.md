# Welcome

Welcome to the MLOps primer! 

This is intended to be a complement to the <xx consumption motion>, and a miniature training guide to help
CSAs and customers better understand the MLOps process, and capabilities leveraging Azure Machine Learning.

MLOps is often confused with just Devops and automation. This is a big part of it, but the added complication
of managing a model's accuracy and understanding changes in data are areas that require additional thinking,
management and practices. This is not easy and many customers struggle to ensure their ML initiatives become
and stay production worthy.

To help illustrate some of the challenges, we have taken an approach of <focusing more on the post deployment
considerations that crop up, and specifically how AML offers capabilities to manage the whole lifecycle.> As
the product changes, we will update sections for this, and do our best to keep this a living document.

Behind this notebook and content sits a full working deployment that can be accessed
[here](https://github.com/ts-azure-services/mlops-primer/tree/main/scripts). The goal of this is to ensure individuals can follow along and reproduce the same results.

Also mention that this pivots heavier towards concepts around drift.

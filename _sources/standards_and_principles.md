# Standards and Principles
1. **Transition Friction.**
	- Use notebook templates that define common functionality e.g. database connection template, fetching
	  data, etc.
	- Proper documentation.
2. **Version Control System.**
	- Version control system for code, data, environments and artifacts.
3. **Performance.** Leverage distributed computing and containerization tools, e.g. Docker, Kubernetes.
4. **Automation.**
	- Build workflows, CI/CD pipelines.
	- MLOps is pipeline-centric. Put pipelines in production for reproducability.
5. **Monitoring.**
	- Powerful innovative monitoring tools to monitor data, features, distribution, latency, uptime and
	  memory utilization, etc.
	- Monitoring tools, e.g. Prometheus, Grafana.
6. **Continuous Training.** Automated retraining of models based on triggers or regular frequency.

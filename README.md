# mlops-csa-playbook
- A repo to educate on the MLOps process, with a case study in pratice.
- This is meant to provide CSA education on this topic, for ongoing education.

## Parking Lot
- Train the model
- Ensure that there are exceptions in the code in the first step of the pipeline
- Get all the metrics of the model downloaded and viewable.
- Download the model, register the model, and tie the dataset to the model
- Be able to run an inference against the model itself in ACI
- Reference the Kaggle resource for ideas on exploration

Feedback from meeting:
- The real litmus test for whether this is impactful is if this is useful to a customer and drives MLOps conversations. After completing this, we want to take this to customers like Trimble, Workday, etc. and see if this is consumable and addresses questions around the platform.
- A lot of existing documentation and collateral can quickly become overwhelming because you start clicking on all the links. For this book, minimize the potential to "click away" and keep the narrative moving forward.
- We are picking 'predicting churn' as a generalized problem across enterprises to illustrate MLOps concepts in AML. This should not be construed to be our recommendation for how to predict churn since these capabilities exist in various products. We are merely using this dataset and storyline to highlight capabilities of the platform, in the context of MLOps.

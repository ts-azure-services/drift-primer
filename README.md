# mlops-csa-playbook
- A repo to educate on the MLOps process in Azure Machine Learning, completed with a case study for illustration.
- Meant to support both CSA and customer education on MLOps processes and practices.
- Setup as a Jupyter book, minimizing cross-referenced links to keep the design simple and consummable.
- Leverages 'customer churn' as the general theme to illustrate the MLOps process in AML. This is not intended
  to the best practice recommendation for how to predict customer churn using Microsoft/Azure products &
  services.
